# SQL-Challenge

Hello again!

Thank you dear grader for viewing my repository for the Module 9 SQL Challenge!

I am super excited about this module as it is one of the most cruical tool in a data analysts tool belt! You better believe I will be diving deeper into this in the next challenge and continuing to practice this to near perfection!
Back to this challenge though!

I used the quick DBD to create my erd, I included png's of the erd itself as well as the code used to create erd in the main SQL-Challenge folder. Also included in the SQL-Challenge frolder is the Employees Schema and Employees Queries. These files hold the sql code for creating my tables in the EmployeeSQL DataBase and my queries to the 8 analysis points asked. 

All code was created by me with the help of the class materials and the classes AI tool for troubleshooting. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or want me to upload the outputs!

Thank you so much!
